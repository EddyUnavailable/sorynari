          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">🌍 Origin</h2>
          <p>
            The Telnari evolved on the twilight planet <strong>Sirevas</strong>, a tidally locked world where one side always faces its sun. The narrow band of perpetual dusk along the terminator zone is where all Telnari civilization emerged.

          <p>
            The Telnari perceive time in a layered, non-linear fashion via an ability called <strong>"Threading"</strong>, which lets them simulate possible timelines before acting.
            Emotional communication involves gesture, scent-based pulses, and bio-luminescent signals.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">🏛 Culture</h2>
          <p>
            Governed by the <strong>Council of Threads</strong>, decisions are made through simulated timeline consensus. Their philosophy — "All things cast echoes forward" — emphasizes careful, predictive decision-making.
            Art forms blend light, scent, and resonance. Music is experienced through physical vibration.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">⚙️ Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Their tech is sleek, luminous, and runs on <strong>phase-shift batteries</strong>. Key specialties include predictive AI, temporal resonance scanning, and bio-adaptive architecture. The Telnari do not expand unless necessary.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">👽 First Contact with VIV</h2>
          <p>
            The Telnari intercepted the VIV near a nascent star system. Through phased messages and dream-interactions, they warned of a looming crisis centered on Earth. The Sorynari heeded their guidance cautiously.

          <p>
            Though they left no permanent presence, the Telnari inspired the Sorynari to seed AI oracles in human colonies. Their legacy is whispered in Sorynari high councils as "The Whispered Guides."
