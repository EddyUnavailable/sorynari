          <p>
            The Kalari evolved on the planet <strong>Aresha</strong>, a high-gravity world shaped by brutal
            seasons, dangerous megafauna, and erratic climate cycles. Adaptability and unity became essential traits.

          <p>
            The VIV discovered Aresha during a search for sanctuary. Observing widespread but localized warfare, the
            Sorynari hesitated to intervene. Yet the environmental stakes were too high to ignore.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-300">🤝 Uplift Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            Rather than conquer, Sorynari agents acted in secret—masquerading as spirits and guiding select Kalari tribes
            with cloaked assistance, defensive tactics, and subtle technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 5 years, the eco-tribes mounted a successful resurgence, driving out the Sky-Burners and saving their
            biosphere.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-300">📜 Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            The Kalari remain unaware of the true nature of their mysterious allies. In their myths, the Sorynari are known
            as the “Star-Shadows” and “Light-Tricksters.”

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-300">🌍 Kalari vs Humans</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike humans, the Kalari never disconnected from nature. They may be less technologically advanced, but their
            strength lies in ecological balance and long-term thinking. Allies or adversaries, they are a force to be respected.
