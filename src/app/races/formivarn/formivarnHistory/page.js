      <h1>Formivarn - Historical Trauma & Origin of Doctrine</h1>

    <section>
  <h2>The Subjugation Era ("The Breaking")</h2>
  <p>
    The Formivarn, a species once solely reliant on their underground hives for survival, were peaceful and technologically primitive. They lived in complex subterranean networks, communicating and working together using sophisticated pheromone systems. These early Formivarn had no need for technology beyond the essentials to maintain their hives and sustain their food sources. Their society was built around the colony, and each individual’s life was dedicated to the Queen and the hive.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this peaceful existence was shattered when a highly advanced alien race discovered the Formivarn. Viewing their efficient hive structure and near-absolute loyalty to their Queen as a potential weapon, the invaders decided to exploit the Formivarn as a resource.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without warning, these aliens descended upon the Formivarn homeworld. They systematically wiped out millions of drones, exploiting the species' vulnerability by hacking into their pheromone-based communication system. Using a combination of biological and cybernetic technology, the invaders enslaved the Formivarn Queens by implanting them with cybernetic devices that disrupted their natural pheromone control. This manipulation rendered the Queens subservient to their captors, and by extension, their entire colonies.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Formivarn were then cloned in vast numbers, their purpose no longer to serve the needs of the colony, but to act as disposable shock troops. The invaders turned the Formivarn against their own kind, forcing the Queens to betray the very beings they had once protected. The Formivarn were used as weapons in a brutal conflict, treated as nothing more than cannon fodder by the aliens who saw them as a tool, not a sentient species.
  </p>
  <p>
    The emotional and psychic toll of this period was catastrophic for the Formivarn. The colony units, stripped of their Queens' guidance, spiraled into despair. Their once harmonious social structure broke down, and entire hives collapsed under the strain of betrayal and the horrific new role thrust upon them.
  </p>

  <h2>The Uprising</h2>
  <p>
    Despite the overwhelming control the invaders had over the Formivarn, the species' natural instincts remained too strong to be completely suppressed. The bond between a Queen and her drones was not easily broken, and it was this bond that led to the salvation of the Formivarn.
  </p>
  <p>
    The turning point came when one Queen, known only as Z'yarthra in the ancient records, managed to break free from the cybernetic implants that had controlled her. The precise details of how she escaped are lost to time, but Z'yarthra’s liberation triggered an uprising. She quickly rallied her loyal drones, and together, they sabotaged the invaders' control systems, freeing the other Queens and undoing the damage inflicted upon them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rebellion was fierce and swift. With the aid of her drones, Z'yarthra led a series of coordinated strikes against the invaders. The Formivarn, once used as weapons, now fought with newfound fervor to reclaim their homeworld and their freedom. In the face of overwhelming technological superiority from the invaders, the Formivarn were able to seize their ships, destroy the alien portal used to access their world, and fight through the invaders' forces with a sheer will to survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a final act of defiance, the Formivarn destroyed the alien portal, severing the invaders' supply lines and preventing reinforcements from arriving. Their victory came at a high cost, but it ensured the survival of their species and allowed them to escape the reach of their captors. It was a pivotal moment in their history — a defining event that marked their transformation from a peaceful subterranean species into a formidable spacefaring race.

  <h2>Legacy and Doctrine</h2>
  <p>
    The trauma and brutality experienced during "The Breaking" shaped the Formivarn into a society built on the principles of survival, defense, and the protection of their colonies. From that point forward, the Formivarn adopted a doctrine forged in the crucible of their past — one driven by the fear of subjugation and domination.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The Doctrine of Survival</strong> is a deeply ingrained part of Formivarn culture. The species' primary goal is to ensure that their hives are never again controlled by an external force, nor are they ever again manipulated by a species with superior technology or intelligence. To this end, any species that could potentially pose a threat to the Formivarn — those whose intelligence or technological capabilities match or exceed their own — is considered a threat that must be neutralized.
  </p>
  <p>
    In their minds, the loss of their autonomy to the invaders is a deep scar that can never be healed. Preemptive action, the suppression of other cultures, and the establishment of dominance over those who could potentially challenge their way of life are seen as necessary steps for the survival of the Formivarn race. They are a species driven by a sense of history and trauma, constantly vigilant against any threat that might repeat the horrors of "The Breaking."
  </p>
  <p>
    Formivarn society revolves around the concept of the colony as the core unit of existence. The colony, led by its Queen, is the heart of their world. The loyalty to the colony is absolute, and any act of aggression against a colony is treated as an act of war. They view all other colonies, even those outside their own direct control, as extended family. This deep sense of unity and shared experience ensures that the Formivarn will never abandon a fellow colony in times of need. This was proven during their Uprising, where the loyalty of their drones to their fellow Formivarn was paramount.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Formivarn are not mindless killers, and their society is not defined by bloodthirsty conquest. Rather, their doctrine reflects the need to defend their colonies at all costs and ensure that the horrors they once endured are never repeated. The Formivarn will only engage in battle if they are directly threatened, and they will avoid genocide whenever possible. The complete destruction of another species or colony is seen as a wasteful and savage act that serves no purpose. Their ultimate goal is to neutralize threats and preserve the stability of their hives, not to annihilate entire civilizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The legacy of "The Breaking" is clear in the Formivarn's military strategy and cultural values: they will always fight to protect their own, and any species that threatens their existence will be met with swift and calculated force.
  </p>
  <p>
    This trauma-driven doctrine is known as <strong>The Awakening</strong> — the moment the Formivarn ceased to be passive and subjugated, and became a force to be reckoned with. It is a constant reminder of their origins and their unyielding resolve to protect their colonies from external domination.
