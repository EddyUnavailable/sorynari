        <h2>Lifespan & Aging</h2>
        <p>
          Humans typically live between 70 and 100 years, with biological aging
          accelerating after mid-life. Longevity can vary based on genetics,
          environment, and technology.

        <h2>Reproduction</h2>
        <p>
          Humans reproduce sexually, with internal gestation lasting approximately
          9 months. Parental care is long-term, with social and emotional bonding
          playing a key role in development.

        <h2>Immunities & Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>
          Humans are vulnerable to a variety of diseases but possess an adaptive
          immune system. Technological advances have increased resistance through
          vaccines and treatments.
