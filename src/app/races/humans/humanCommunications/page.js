      <h1>Human Communication & Language</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Primary Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Humans primarily use spoken and written languages to communicate. Over 7,000 languages exist on Earth,
          though a few major ones dominate in global discourse. Body language, facial expressions, and tone
          often add subtext to speech.

      <section>
        <h2>Non-Verbal Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Humans rely heavily on non-verbal cues: posture, eye movement, gestures, and emotional expression. 
          These cues often transcend linguistic boundaries, making them vital in diplomacy and interspecies relations.

        <h2>Language & Technology</h2>
        <p>
          With the rise of advanced AI and real-time translation tools, language barriers have diminished. 
          Voice interfaces, thought-to-speech implants, and gesture-based controls are common in human interfaces.

        <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Language plays a central role in cultural identity. Ancient languages are preserved through 
          ritual, literature, and digital archiving. Proverbs, idioms, and storytelling continue to be 
          key tools for transmitting values and knowledge.
