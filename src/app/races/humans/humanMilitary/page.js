      <h1>Military & Defense</h1>
      <p>
        Humanity's military capabilities have evolved alongside their technological progress and socio-political
        developments. Over centuries, humans have transitioned from primitive tribal warfare to sophisticated
        planetary and interstellar defense strategies.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Modern human militaries are often structured into branches such as ground forces, naval fleets,
        aerospace divisions, and cyber defense units. Chain-of-command and strategic doctrines vary depending
        on regional or planetary governance.
      </p>

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Human military technology includes powered exosuits, AI-assisted tactics, energy weapons, stealth ships,
        orbital defense systems, and advanced battlefield medics capable of trauma regeneration.
      </p>

      <h2>Tactics & Doctrine</h2>
      <p>
        Tactics emphasize adaptability, combined arms coordination, and asymmetric warfare when outmatched.
        Human commanders are known for creative improvisation under pressure.
      </p>

      <h2>Historical Conflicts</h2>
      <p>
        From global conflicts on Earth to off-world rebellions and first-contact wars, humanityâ€™s military
        history is marked by both catastrophic loss and unifying victories.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Military Alliances</h2>
      <p>
        Various interstellar coalitions and mutual defense pacts shape current military policy. The Terran
        Coalition Navy, for example, operates across multiple human colonies and allied systems.
      </p>
