        <h1>üåå The Fall and Flight of the Sorynari</h1>
        <p>
          The Sorynari, a feline-primate hybrid species of great agility and intellect, thrived across their home system: the planet Nari and its moons Tavuun and Calari. Their society was harmonious, technologically advanced, and culturally rich. For generations, they lived in golden age serenity ‚Äî until the skies darkened with the arrival of the Formivarn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Formivarn, a brutal and expansionist hive species, launched a sudden and overwhelming invasion. Using hive carrier fleets, they crippled Sorynari defenses and began a swift campaign of subjugation. Cities fell in hours, moons were converted into staging posts, and billions were lost or enslaved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sorynari were driven to near extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a miracle occurred. A rebel faction stole a partially completed Formivarn colony ship from the moon Tavuun. In a daring campaign, they freed thousands more, launched into space, and escaped. This ship became their new home and symbol: <strong>VIV</strong>.
        </p>
  
        <h2>üöÄ Exodus aboard the VIV</h2>
        <p>
          The VIV was transformed into a mobile city-ship ‚Äî a 70 km-long lifeline carrying ~200,000 Sorynari. Repurposed mining equipment, hydroponic bays, and industrial wings became tools of survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hunted and haunted, the Sorynari fled across the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, the VIV approached a distant, Earth-like planet. Observations revealed a humanoid species just beginning industrial civilization ‚Äî primitive, fragile, and fractious, but promising.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prevent this species from following the same path as others, the Sorynari made a radical decision: <strong>They would not uplift, they would invade</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their plan was to unite the planet‚Äôs civilizations through fear, forcing global collaboration. They would guide this species toward survival ‚Äî through coercion, if necessary.
        </p>
  
        <h2>üåç The Earth War</h2>
        <p>
          The VIV approached Earth silently, positioning itself behind a gas giant to mask emissions. The Sorynari launched an initial fleet of drones and landed on three continents simultaneously. Their appearance ‚Äî graceful, alien, catlike ‚Äî triggered both fascination and fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the Sorynari&apos;s technological edge, Earth resisted. Nations allied in desperation. The war lasted 9 Earth years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sorynari did not use lethal force unless necessary, preserving infrastructure and populations. But Earth&apos;s militaries suffered heavily. Satellites were disabled. Communications cut. Cities occupied. Entire armies humiliated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, Earth&apos;s nations surrendered under a unified treaty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sorynari established a World Council, selecting cooperative human leaders to act as intermediaries. Education programs began, infrastructure was rebuilt, and environmental damage was slowly reversed.
        </p>
  
        <h2>üîÅ After the Earth War</h2>
        <p>
          Despite their subjugation, many humans thrived under Sorynari oversight. Wars stopped. Disease was controlled. Poverty began to vanish.
        </p>
        <p>
          But resistance continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some humans saw the Sorynari as invaders. Others, as reluctant saviors. Conspiracy movements grew. Underground factions formed, hoping to retake Earth by force ‚Äî unaware of what lurked beyond the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the Sorynari began to seed Earth with hidden defenses. In time, they hoped to leave humanity as its own guardian. But first, they needed to prepare Earth for what might come next:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The Formivarn ‚Äî who had not forgotten the theft of their ship.  
          Who had not stopped expanding.  
          Who were still coming.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          And so the VIV stayed hidden in orbit, watching and waiting... for the day humanity might join the galactic stage, not as prey ‚Äî but as equals.
