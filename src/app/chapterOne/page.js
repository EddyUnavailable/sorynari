        <h1 className={styles.chapterTitle}>Chapter 1: The Arrival</h1>

        <h2 className={styles.chapterHeading}>[1] — A Silent Journey</h2>
        <p className={styles.chapterParagraph}>The ship hid within the gas giant’s storms, moving without lights — a shadow among swirling clouds. Small craft slipped in and out, returning one by one to the vessel.</p>
        <p>When the last craft docked, the ship stirred. Its surface shifted. Engines hummed, bringing the ship to life. Like a chameleon, its skin lit up, turning its armor deep green and orange. A name appeared along its side: <strong>VIV</strong>.</p>
        <p>The time for hiding was over.</p>
        <p>A soft blue glow spread from its thrusters, slowly pushing the VIV from the gas giant’s embrace. Its destination was set.</p>
        <p>The ship accelerated to a tremendous speed, but in the vast void of space, the journey felt long, slow, and silent. Hours passed, and the tiny speck ahead gradually became a world of blue oceans and green landmasses, cloaked in spirals of white cloud.</p>
        <p>A planet divided by too many governments, too many clashing voices — and completely unaware of what was coming.</p>
        <p>The VIV slowed and gracefully dropped into a high orbit. Despite its colossal size, it would be little more than a speck to those on the surface.</p>

        <h2>[2] — First Transmission</h2>
        <p>Admiral Krissack stood before the primary observational terminal of the VIV’s bridge. Tall, slender, his short yellow hair neatly trimmed, he clasped his hands behind his back.</p>
        <p>Leaning slightly forward, he gave the command.</p>
        <p>His voice, calm and deliberate — unmistakably alien — was absorbed by the VIV’s communications matrix. In mere fractions of a second, the ship’s computer molded it into flawless translation across the globe.</p>

        <blockquote className={styles.transmission}>
          Attention, species designation XHU9512 of system OCA122437XX9.<br/>
          I am Admiral Krissack of the VIV, acting under the authority of Galactic Environmental Planetary Protection.<br/>
          Your species has been observed accelerating the degradation of your planetary ecosystem.<br/>
          Immediate compliance is expected.<br/>
          Failure to comply will result in the eradication of all governing structures.<br/>
          Dialogue will not be entertained.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The message broadcast without pause, flooding every major communication network — public and private — in an endless, mechanical loop. There would be no debate. No misunderstanding.</p>
        <p>The world below shuddered.</p>

        <h2>[3] — Collapse and Defiance</h2>
        <p>Krissack watched, unblinking, as chaos bloomed.</p>
        <p>Through the VIV’s holoscreens, continents erupted into unrest. Cities burned. Storefronts shattered. Crowds rioted. Governments deployed military forces — tanks and soldiers — to crush the chaos.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, bunkers buzzed with activity. Missiles were readied. Hidden weapons, long kept secret, were activated. Experimental rail systems locked onto their distant target.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, waves of cyber-attacks clawed at the VIV’s outer systems. Clumsy. Desperate. Futile. Each intrusion was effortlessly deflected — like insects against armor.</p>
        <p>Krissack did not react. This was expected.</p>
        <p>All the while, the same cold ultimatum repeated across the planet’s airwaves, an endless drumbeat of inevitability.</p>
        <p>Two full planetary rotations passed in uneasy silence. No surrender came — only seething defiance gathering in the dark.</p>

        <h2>[4] — The Final Gambit</h2>
        <p>When the second rotation ended, violence erupted.</p>
        <p>Across every major landmass, missiles tore into the sky — thousands of bright, angry flares rising in a final, furious assault.</p>
        <p>Soft alerts chimed across the bridge.</p>
        <p>Krissack remained still at the observational terminal.</p>

        <p>Incoming transmissions flooded in — angry, desperate:</p>
        <blockquote className={styles.dialogue}>
          "You pushed us to this!"<br/>
          "You gave us no choice!"<br/>
          "Leave, or be destroyed!"
        </blockquote>

        <p>Krissack nodded once to allow their protests — then turned his head slightly.</p>
        <p>The weapons officer awaited orders.</p>

        <p>Without turning fully, Krissack spoke:</p>
        <blockquote className={styles.dialogue}>
          "Only the missiles."
        </blockquote>

        <p>The VIV’s weapons arrays activated instantly. Brilliant green beams lanced outward, meeting the rising warheads with silent, surgical precision. Thousands of missiles vaporized mid-flight, reduced to sterile flashes.</p>

        <p>On the holoscreens, planetary leaders watched helplessly.</p>

        <p>Krissack allowed a faint smile and said:</p>
        <blockquote className={styles.dialogue}>
          "Ah. Apologies. Was distracted by the fireworks."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>[5] — The Railgun Salvo</h2>
        <p>A new alert flashed across the VIV’s tactical displays. Six hypersonic slugs streaked toward the ship — the planet’s last, hidden weapon.</p>
        <p>The weapons officer awaited confirmation.</p>
        <p>Admiral Krissack simply raised one hand — and shook his head.</p>
        <p>Let them see.</p>

        <p>The slugs struck. Each impact blossomed into plasma against the VIV’s hull — but when the light faded, not even a scratch remained.</p>

        <p>Krissack didn’t blink.</p>

        <blockquote className={styles.dialogue}>
          "You're lucky you didn't scratch her. Otherwise, I would have plucked you from your bunkers and dangled you outside to buff her clean."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>[6] — A New Order</h2>
        <p>Silence stretched, heavy and cold.</p>
        <p>Planetary leaders sat frozen, pale with fear.</p>

        <p>Krissack’s voice cut through the silence:</p>
        <blockquote className={styles.dialogue}>
          "From this moment onward, all military activity will cease. Your forces will restore order among your populations. You will organize for full compliance with future directives. Any government that fails will be eradicated. No warnings. No leniency."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Without waiting for replies, Krissack severed the feeds with a flick of his hand.</p>

        <p>The planet below spun on — bruised, broken, and utterly helpless beneath the shadow of the VIV.  
        Their fate no longer their own.</p>
