      <section>
        <h2>Planet Name</h2>
        <p>
          Earth — the cradle of human civilization — is a terrestrial planet with a balanced
          biosphere, varied climates, and abundant natural resources. Though technologically
          advanced, its environment has faced significant challenges due to industrialization and population growth.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Climate & Terrain</h2>
        <p>
          Earth's climate ranges from frozen polar caps to tropical rainforests and arid deserts. 
          The diversity of terrain — including oceans, mountains, plains, and forests — has shaped 
          the evolution of cultures, agriculture, and infrastructure across the planet.

      <section>
        <h2>Ecological Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Humans have significantly altered their environment through urbanization, deforestation,
          and climate change. Recent centuries have seen a shift toward ecological restoration,
          green energy, and space-based environmental monitoring systems.

      <section>
        <h2>Adaptation & Survival</h2>
        <p>
          Human physiology evolved to adapt to a wide range of temperatures and conditions. 
          Technological advances now allow survival in extreme environments — from deep oceans
          to orbital habitats and beyond.

        <h2>Off-World Colonies</h2>
        <p>
          Humans have established colonies on the Moon, Mars, and various space stations. These outposts 
          use terraforming technologies, artificial ecosystems, and supply chains from Earth to support life.
